# solutions to exercises for data structures and algorithms in python
Solutions for exercises from the book Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Michael H. Goldwasser, Michael T. Goodrich, and Roberto Tamassia.

This repo contains some of the solutions starting from `Chapter 5`, mostly the ones I found interesting to code down. Note that some of the solutions might be incorrect, 
therefore I encourage you to double check and submit a PR when/if you find a bug.

I've decided to share a path of my journey towards improving my coding skills, in hope that some of you might find some of the solutions useful. Also, I have many of
the solutions are in paper edition so feel free to ask, I'd be happy to share if I have it.

Under the folder "custom" are placed algorithms and it's variants mentioned in the book, which I've found useful to code first, before jumping into the exercises. Folder
"input" contains some of the bigger inputs I've used to test different scripts - mostly trees.

Also feel free to contribute some of the exercises that I've missed.

I've personally found this book more than useful, with plenty of challenging tasks and "smart" ideas. Big thanks to the authors! 

Good luck, and enjoy your path to becoming a skilled software developer! :)
